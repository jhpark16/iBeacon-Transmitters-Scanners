## Bluetooth Low Energy iBeacon Transmitters and Scanners

iBeacon is Apple's Bluetooth low-energy wireless technology to provide location based information and services. It is similar to AltBeacon and Google's Eddystone. All these beacons are transmitters and use the same BLE advertising packet transmission technologies. The packet can deliver up to 37 bytes of data per transmission. The beacons are constructed with a microcontroller such as nRF51822 and ESP32 and the beacon signals are received by iOS or Android mobile Apps. Here, Android and iOS mobile Apps are constructed to interact with embedded microcontrollers (nRF51822 and ESP32) implementing BLE technology.
